# Pointer-Basics
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address as its value.  A pointer variable points to a data type (like int or string) of the same type, and is created with the * operator. The address of the variable you're working with is assigned to the pointer.



# **AIM**

Pointers

Pointers are symbolic representations of addresses. They enable programs to simulate call-by-reference as well as to create and manipulate dynamic data structures. Iterating over elements in arrays or other data structures is one of the main use of pointers. 

The address of the variable you’re working with is assigned to the pointer variable that points to the same data type (such as an int or string).

Syntax:

datatype *var_name; 

int *ptr;   // ptr can point to an address which holds int data




Define a pointer variable

Assigning the address of a variable to a pointer using the unary operator (&) which returns the address of that variable.
Accessing the value stored in the address using unary operator (*) which returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand.
The reason we associate data type with a pointer is that it knows how many bytes the data is stored in. When we increment a pointer, we increase the pointer by the size of the data type to which it points.



## **ALGORITHM**

- **Pointer Array**

1.Include the necessary header file for input and output operations, i.e., <iostream>.

2.Declare the use of the std namespace to avoid having to prepend std:: before standard library objects like cout.

3.Define a function increment that takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and increments the value stored at that memory location.

4.Define a function swap that takes two pointers to integers as parameters and swaps the values stored at those memory locations.

5.In the main function:

6.Declare an integer array arr with four elements: 10, 20, 30, and 40.

7.Declare an integer variable i to be used as an index.

8.Declare a pointer to an integer ptr and initialize it with the address of arr[i].

9.Use a for loop to iterate through the elements of arr:

- Print the value pointed to by ptr.
- Print the address of the current element in the array.
- Increment the ptr to point to the next element in the array.
- Declare another integer array arr1 with the same values as arr.

10.Declare an integer variable j to be used as an index.

11.Use a for loop to print the elements of arr1.

12.Declare an integer variable b and set its initial value to 2.

13.Call the increment function, passing the address of b as an argument.

14.Print the updated value of b.

15.Declare two integer variables c and d with initial values 15 and 20, respectively.

16.Print the values of c and d.

17.Call the swap function, passing the addresses of c and d as arguments, which will swap their values.

18.Print the values of c and d again to show the effect of the swap.

19.Declare a character pointer str and initialize it with the address of a string literal "Symbiosis Institute of Technology".

20.Use pointer arithmetic to print the characters at specific positions in the string.

- **Pointer Increament**

1.Include the necessary header file for input and output operations, i.e., <iostream>.

2.Declare the use of the std namespace to avoid having to prepend std:: before standard library objects like cout.

3.Declare an integer variable a and initialize it with the value 10.

4.Declare an integer pointer aptr.

5.Declare a float variable fl_value and initialize it with the value 34.56.

6.Declare a float pointer fl_ptr.

7.Declare a character variable cr_value and initialize it with the character 'a'.

8.Declare a character pointer cr_ptr.

9.Assign the address of a to the aptr pointer.

10.Print the value of a, the address of a, and the value of aptr.

11.Declare a pointer to a pointer to an integer aptr2 and assign it the address of aptr. This creates a double pointer to a.

12.Increment the aptr pointer by 1 (sizeof(int)). This will change its address to the next integer location.

13.Print the value of the incremented aptr and the value of the double pointer aptr2.

14.Assign the address of fl_value to the fl_ptr pointer.

15.Print the value of fl_value, the value of fl_ptr, and the incremented value of fl_ptr. Incrementing fl_ptr will change its address to the next float location.

16.Assign the address of cr_value to the cr_ptr pointer.

17.Print the value of cr_value, the value of cr_ptr, and the incremented value of cr_ptr. Incrementing cr_ptr will change its address to the next character location.

18.Return 0 to end the program.

- **pointer_swap**

1.Include the necessary header file for input and output operations, i.e., <iostream>.

2.Declare the use of the std namespace to avoid having to prepend std:: before standard library objects like cout.

3.Define a function increment that takes a pointer to an integer int *a as a parameter. This function increments the value stored at the memory location pointed to by a.

4.Define a function swap that takes two pointers to integers int *a and int *b as parameters. This function swaps the values stored at the memory locations pointed to by a and b.

5.In the main function:

6.Declare an integer variable b and set its initial value to 2.

7.Call the increment function, passing the address of b as an argument. This will increment the value of b.

8.Print the updated value of b after the increment.

9.Declare two integer variables, c and d, with initial values 15 and 20, respectively.

10.Print the values of c and d before swapping.

11.Call the swap function, passing the addresses of c and d as arguments. This will swap the values of c and d.

12.Print the values of c and d after swapping to show the effect of the swap.

13.Return 0 to end the program.

1.Include the necessary header file for input and output operations, i.e., <iostream>.

2.Declare the use of the std namespace to avoid having to prepend std:: before standard library objects like cout.

3.Define a function increment that takes a pointer to an integer int *a as a parameter. This function increments the value stored at the memory location pointed to by a.

7.Print the value of a, the value pointed to by aptr (dereferenced value), and the address of a.

8.Increment the aptr pointer by 1 (sizeof(int)). This will change its address to the next integer location.
